# 🔐 Password Security Analyzer

![Password Security Analyzer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security-High-important?style=for-the-badge)

## 🚀 Overview
**Password Security Analyzer** is a **cybersecurity tool** that evaluates **password strength**, estimates **brute force cracking time**, and checks for **dictionary attack vulnerabilities** using interactive **visualizations**. The project is designed for **security enthusiasts, ethical hackers, and researchers** to gain insights into password security.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Password Strength Analysis** – Categorizes passwords as **Very Weak, Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong**.
✅ **Brute Force Attack Estimation** – Calculates the estimated time required to crack the password.
✅ **Dictionary Attack Check** – Verifies if the password appears in **leaked password databases**.
✅ **Interactive Visualizations** – Clear, aligned, and user-friendly **bar charts** for better understanding.
✅ **Google Colab Compatible** – No installation required, works directly in **the cloud**.

## 📊 Example Output
```
Enter a password to analyze: Secure@123
🔍 Password Strength: Strong
⏳ Estimated Brute Force Cracking Time: 3.45e+10 seconds
✅ This password is NOT in common leaked password lists.
```

**🖼 Visual Output (Graphs are perfectly aligned! 🎨)**
✔ Password Strength Bar Chart (Black bar highlights user input strength)
✔ Time-to-Crack (Log Scale) Bar Chart
✔ Dictionary Attack Check (Green ✅ for safe, Red ⚠️ for unsafe)
